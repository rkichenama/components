This component was initially born out of an attempt to use the Github GraphQL api to pull user profile data. With the richness of v4, I had hoped to pull info like current PRs, any issues raised or answered, along with commit history.

Unforutnately, not only would v4 require oauth, but creating the query seemed beyond what I could straigtforwardly do. That said, I settled for the v3 public version that is rate limited and gives extremely basic information.
